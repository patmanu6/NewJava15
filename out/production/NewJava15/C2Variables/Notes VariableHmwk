1)Declare two variables firstName and lastName of type String and initialize them to your
first and last name. Use string concatenation to create a new variable fullName that contains
your full name. Print the value of fullName.
2)Declare two variables num1 and num2 of type int and initialize them to values of your choice.
Add the two numbers together and store the result in a new variable sum. Print the value of sum.
3)Declare two variables num1 and num2 of type int and initialize them to values of your choice.
Subtract num2 from num1 and store the result in a new variable difference. Print the value of
difference.
4)Declare two variables num1 and num2 of type int and initialize them to values of your choice.
Multiply the two numbers together and store the result in a new variable product. Print the value
of product.
5)Declare two variables num1 and num2 of type int and initialize them to values of your choice.
Divide num1 by num2 and store the result in a new variable quotient. Print the value of quotient.

6)Declare two variables firstName and lastName of type String and initialize them to your first and
last name. Use string concatenation to create a new variable greeting that says "Hello, [firstName]
[lastName]!". Print the value of greeting.
7)Declare two variables num1 and num2 of type int and initialize them to values of your choice.
Use modulus operator to find the remainder when num1 is divided by num2 and store the result in a
new variable remainder. Print the value of remainder.
8)Declare two variables num1 and num2 of type int and initialize them to values of your choice.
Use the increment operator to increase the value of num1 by 1, and the decrement operator to decrease
the value of num2 by 1. Print the new values of num1 and num2.
9)Declare two variables num1 and num2 of type double and initialize them to values of your choice.
Use the Math class to calculate the square root of num1 and store the result in a new variable sqrt.
Use the Math class to calculate the power of num1 to num2 and store the result in a new variable power.
Print the values of sqrt and power.
10)Declare three variables num1, num2, and num3 of type int and initialize them to values of your
choice. Use parentheses to specify the order of operations, and perform the following calculation:
num1 + num2 * num3. Store the result in a new variable result and print its value.

==========================================
Task1:
create an int variable call is age store 16 in it
then write an if condition which checks if age is greater than 18 print
"you are allowed to vote" otherwise print you are too young to vote
Task2:
write a program in which create a variable call it food store pizza in it.
then write an if condition which checks if food variable contains pizza it
prints "i love pizza" otherwise it prints "i haven't tried that food"

Task3:
write a java program that checks if a variable contains letter 'M' it should
print "male" otherwise it should print "female"

Task 4 :
Write a Java program that declares two integer variables,
 assigns them values, and prints the larger value.

Task5:
    Write a Java program that declares a boolean variable and
     prints "yes" if the value is true, and "no" if the value is false.
