In programming class is a logical entity that we use to organize our code.
we can put methods in a class we can also put attributes or in other words we can have some
variables as well if we want to store some data as well.
how do we organize:
Lets there are 15 features in our program that we want to build for example a shopping website
Users: for example Admin Customer
    Can login logout they can have usernames password.
A class to manage payments
a class to manage carts
User:
    Name
    Address
    mobileNumber
    Card Number
    emails
    password
    login()
    logout()
    addItemsTo()
Card:
    Card Number
    name on the card
    balance
    CVS code
    Type
    Expiry dat
=====================
The Biggest things that we can achieve from a class.
    1)We can use a class to represent an entity from real life a class can act as a design guide or template
    that we can use and create real life objects inside computers.
    2) A class helps us organize our code we can put similar types of methods inside a class and
    then end users can create objects from the classes and can start using those methods.
