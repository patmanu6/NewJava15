Task1:
    1)Create a HashSet and store fruit like  "Apple" "Banana" "Kiwi"
    2)print all the elements from the set without a loop
    3)Print all the elements from the set using a loop Hint! Try Enhanced loop.
Task2:
    1)Create a Set  called 'words' that stores a String.
    2)Add the following strings to the 'words' TreeSet using the add() method: "apple", "banana", "orange", "peach".
    3)Write a loop to print all the words in alphabetical order.
Task3:
    1)Create a HashSet object called 'numbers' that stores an Integer.
    2)Add the following integers to the 'numbers' HashSet using the add() method: 10, 20, 30, 40.
    3)Write a loop to calculate and print the sum of all the integers in the 'numbers' HashSet.

Task4:
    1)Create a TreeSet object called 'ages' that stores an Integer.
    2)Add the following integers to the 'ages' TreeSet using the add() method: 20, 25, 30, 35.
    3)Remove all the elements from the TreeSet that are less than 30, then print the remaining elements of the TreeSet
Task5:
    1)Create a HashSet object called 'names' that stores a String.
    2)Add the following strings to the 'names' HashSet using the add() method: "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David".
    3)Remove the names which contain the letter 'a' or 'A', then print the remaining elements of the HashSet.
