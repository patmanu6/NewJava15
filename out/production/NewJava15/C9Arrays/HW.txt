Task1
Declare an integer array and initialize it with values.
Create a for loop that will iterate over each element in the array.
Within the for loop, use the current index to access the current element's value.
Print out a message that displays the index and value of the current element.
After the message has been printed, the for loop will move on to the next element in the array and repeat the process until all elements have been printed


Task 2: Find the sum of all elements in an array of integers

Create an array of integers with some values using method two of creating arrays
Initialize a variable to hold the sum to 0
Use a for loop to iterate over all elements in the array
Add each element to the sum variable
Print out the total sum of all elements

Task 3: Print out all even numbers in an array of integers

Create an array of integers with some values using method two of creating arrays
Use a for-each loop to iterate over all elements in the array
Use an if statement to check if the element is even
If the element is even, print it out

Task 4: Calculate the average of all elements in an array of doubles

Create an array of doubles with some values
Initialize a variable to hold the sum to 0.0
Use a for loop to iterate over all elements in the array
Add each element to the sum variable
Divide the sum by the length of the array to calculate the average
Print out the average
================================================================
Not Step by step
Task5
Create a double array with 5 elements and fill it with random decimal
values between 1.0 and 5.0. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and
print out all the values that are greater than 3.0.
Task6
Create an integer array with 8 elements and fill it with random
values between 1 and 10. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and
count how many times the value 5 appears.
Task7
Create an integer array with 7 elements and fill it with random values
between 1 and 10. Use a while loop to iterate over the array and print out
all the odd numbers.
Task8
Create an integer array with 8 elements and fill it with random values
between 1 and 50. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and print out all the values that are less than 25
Task9:
Create an integer array with 10 elements and fill it with random values
between 1 and 100. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and find the
sum of all the even numbers.
Task10:
Create an integer array with 8 elements and fill it with random
values between 1 and 10. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and
find the index of the first occurrence of the value 5.
Task11:
Create an integer array with 6 elements and fill it
with random values between 1 and 10. Use a for loop to iterate over
the array and find the index of the last occurrence of the value 5.
Task11:
Create an integer array with 7 elements and fill it with random
values between 1 and 20. Use a while loop to iterate over the array
and print out all the values that are odd and greater than 10.
Task12:
Create an array of size 5
use scanner class to take 5 numbers from user and store them inside above array
print all the elements from above array using a loop
task13:
create a variable of type int and call it size
use scanner to ask the user for the size of array and store that
in above variable
create an empty array of that size
use scanner again to fill that array
use a loop to print all the elements from above array
=====================================
tough ones not easy
Task14
Create an integer array with 10 elements and fill it with random values
between 1 and 20. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and find the
largest value.
Task15
Create a double array with 6 elements and fill it with random decimal
values between 1.0 and 5.0. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and
find the smallest value
