Task:toCharArray()
    Declare a string variable and assign it a value.
    Call the toCharArray() method on the string variable.
    Store the result in a character array variable.
    Iterate through the character array using a loop and print each character.
Task:split()
    Declare a string variable and assign it a value that contains one or more words separated by spaces.
    Call the split() method on the string variable and pass a space character as the argument.
    Store the result in a string array variable.
    Iterate through the string array using a loop and print each element.
Task:Declare a string variable named str and assign it the value "Java is a programming language".
     Call the replace() method on the str variable and pass two arguments: "Java" as the substring to be replaced, and "Python" as the replacement string. Store the result in a new string variable named newStr.
     Print the original str string with the message "Original string: " using the System.out.println() method.
     Print the new newStr string with the message "New string: " using the System.out.println() method

Tricky ones:
Task1:
    Declare a string variable named sentence and assign it the value "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.".
    Call the split() method on the sentence variable and pass a space " " as the delimiter to split the sentence into an array of words. Store the result in a string array variable named words.
    Declare a string variable named reversedSentence and initialize it to an empty string "".
    Iterate through the words array in reverse order using a for loop that starts at the last index (words.length - 1) and ends at the first index (0).
    For each word in the words array, add it to the reversedSentence variable with a space " " appended to it.
    Print the original sentence string with the message "Original sentence: " using the System.out.println() method.
    Print the reversed reversedSentence string with the message "Reversed sentence: " using the System.out.println() method. Use the trim() method to remove the trailing space at the end of the reversed sentence
Expected output:
Original sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Reversed sentence: dog. lazy the over jumps fox brown quick The
Task2:
    Declare a string variable named str and assign it the value "She sells seashells by the seashore.".
    Call the toCharArray() method on the str variable to convert it to an array of characters. Store the result in a char array variable named charArray.
    Declare a string variable named replacedStr and initialize it to an empty string "".
    Iterate through the charArray array using a for-each loop.
    For each character c in the charArray array, check if it is the letter "s" or "S".
    If c is "s" or "S", append a dollar sign "$" to the replacedStr variable.
    If c is not "s" or "S", append the original character c to the replacedStr variable.
    Print the original str string with the message "Original string: " using the System.out.println() method.
    Print the replacedStr string with the message "Replaced string: " using the System.out.println() method.
Output:
    Original string: She sells seashells by the seashore.
    Replaced string: $he $ell$ $ea$hell$ by the $ea$hore.
Task3:
   Declare a string variable named str and assign it the value "She sells seashells by the seashore.".
      Call the toCharArray() method on the str variable to convert it to an array of characters. Store the result in a char array variable named charArray.
      Declare a string variable named replacedStr and initialize it to an empty string "".
      Iterate through the charArray array using a for-each loop.
      For each character c in the charArray array, check if it is the letter "s" or "S".
      If c is "s" or "S", append a dollar sign "$" to the replacedStr variable.
      If c is not "s" or "S", append the original character c to the replacedStr variable.
      Print the original str string with the message "Original string: " using the System.out.println() method.
      Print the replacedStr string with the message "Replaced string: " using the System.out.println() method.
  Output:
      Original string: She sells seashells by the seashore.
      Replaced string: $he $ell$ $ea$hell$ by the $ea$hore.
    Original string: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    Replaced string: the QUICK brown FOX jumps OVER the LAZY dog.
Task4:
    Declare a string variable named str and assign it the value "Hello, how are you?".
    Call the split() method on the str variable and pass a space " " as the delimiter to split the string into an array of words. Store the result in a string array variable named words.
    Declare a string variable named reversedStr and initialize it to an empty string "".
    Iterate through the words array using a for loop in reverse order.
    Starting from the last index of the words array, append each word to the reversedStr variable with a space " " appended to it.
    Print the original str string with the message "Original string: " using the System.out.println() method.
    Print the reversedStr string with the message "Reversed string: " using the System.out.println() method. Use the trim() method to remove the trailing space at the end of the reversed string.
Output:
    Original string: Hello, how are you?
    Reversed string: you? are how Hello,
