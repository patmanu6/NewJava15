Logical operators allow us to combine multiple conditions
There are three logical operators in java
1)AND operator (&&)
2) OR ||
3) NOT !
AND Operator:
    Execute the code inside if part only if all the conditions are
    true if any of the condition fails it will execute the else part
    if it is present
OR ||:
    Execute the if part as soon as it see one condition to be true
