What do you think that you will be doing on your jobs?
     we are going to test websites, and we will be using some kind java to write
     a piece of software to perform this testing automatically.

Why companies need testers?
    Because companies all the time keep on changing the code and keep on adding
    new features this process might introduce issues in other part of the code.
    and that's why we continuously need to test the websites again and again.
Why companies need automation testers like you.
    If companies test websites manually it might take them months. they need automation
    testers so that they can test websites in minutes or hours.
Why we need java for automation.
    We need a common language that our computers can understand, and we can also understand so
    that we can give instructions to the computer to do things for us.
How does java works is it similar to English?
    yes very similar it also has vocabulary grammar rules punctuations etc.
To better utilize a computer we also need to know a bit of how
computers work.
1) Processors (its like the brain of a human)
   RAM( a temporary storage device just like some parts of our brains store information its like the
   short term memory that we humans have).
   Storage(Hard rives SSDS NVM SSD) to store things for long term for many years just like we humans
   can remember things for many year.
   input device like keyboard mic( to our eys and ears)
   they some output devices like speaker and screens(our hands and hands).
