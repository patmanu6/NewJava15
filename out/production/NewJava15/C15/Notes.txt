Data Structures:
    In java Data structures are classes which help us store and manipulate data
    easily.
Variables:
    Are good to store a single value.
Array:
    Arrays are good for storing more than one value of same type.
Issues with arrays:
    1)They are fixed in the size.
    2) They do not have built-in(ready-made) methods
ArrayList:
    1)Arraylists are not fixed in size. They can grow and shrink
    at run time automatically.
