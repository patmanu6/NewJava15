2)Simple Grade Calculator
    Declare a variable score and assign it a value of 85.
    Write an if statement that checks if the score variable is greater than or equal to 90.
    If the condition is true, print "A" to the console.
    Write an else if statement that checks if the score variable is greater than or equal to 80.
    If the condition is true, print "B" to the console.
    Write an else if statement that checks if the score variable is greater than or equal to 70.
    If the condition is true, print "C" to the console.
    Write an else if statement that checks if the score variable is greater than or equal to 60.
    If the condition is true, print "D" to the console.
    Write an else statement that prints "F" to the console if none of the above conditions are true
1)Simple Calculator:
    Declare two variables num1 and num2 and assign them values of 5 and 10 respectively.
    Declare a third variable operator and assign it the value "+".
    Write an if statement that checks if the operator variable is equal to "+".
    If the condition is true, print the sum of num1 and num2 to the console.
    Write an else if statement that checks if the operator variable is equal to "-".
    If the condition is true, print the difference of num1 and num2 to the console.
    Write an else if statement that checks if the operator variable is equal to "*".
    If the condition is true, print the product of num1 and num2 to the console.
    Write an else if statement that checks if the operator variable is equal to "/".
    If the condition is true, print the quotient of num1 and num2 to the console.
    Write an else statement that prints "Invalid operator" to the console if none of the above conditions are true.
3)Simple BMI Calculator:
    Declare two variables weight and height and assign them values of 70 and 1.75 respectively.
    Calculate the BMI by dividing the weight by the square of the height and assign it to a new variable bmi.
    Write an if statement that checks if the bmi variable is less than 18.5.
    If the condition is true, print "Underweight" to the console.
    Write an else if statement that checks if the bmi variable is less than 25.
    If the condition is true, print "Normal weight" to the console.
    Write an else if statement that checks if the bmi variable is less than 30.
    If the condition is true, print "Overweight" to the console.
    Write an else statement that prints "Obese" to the console if the bmi variable is greater than or equal to 30
4)Task:
  Write a Java program that prints the name of the day of the week based on a given integer value.

  Step 1: Declare an integer variable named dayOfWeek.

  Step 2: Assign a value of 1 to the dayOfWeek variable.

  Step 3: Write an if statement that checks if the value of dayOfWeek is 1.

  Step 4: Inside the if statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "Monday".

  Step 5: Write an else if statement that checks if the value of dayOfWeek is 2.

  Step 6: Inside the else if statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "Tuesday".

  Step 7: Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remaining days of the week (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), using the appropriate integer values and string names.

  Step 8: Write an else statement that executes if none of the previous conditions are true.

  Step 9: Inside the else statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "Invalid day of week".

  Step 10: Save and run the program to see the output.

5) Task: Write a Java program that prints the name of the month based on a given integer value.

   Step 1: Declare an integer variable named month.

   Step 2: Assign a value of 1 to the month variable.

   Step 3: Write an if statement that checks if the value of month is 1.

   Step 4: Inside the if statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "January".

   Step 5: Write an else if statement that checks if the value of month is 2.

   Step 6: Inside the else if statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "February".

   Step 7: Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remaining months of the year (March through December), using the appropriate integer values and string names.

   Step 8: Write an else statement that executes if none of the previous conditions are true.

   Step 9: Inside the else statement, use the System.out.println() method to print the string "Invalid month".

   Step 10: Save and run the program to see the output.
