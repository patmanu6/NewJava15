package C14StringsMethods;
/*
  Declare a string variable named str and assign it the value "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.".
    Call the split() method on the str variable and pass a space " " as the delimiter to split the string into an array of words. Store the result in a string array variable named words.
    Declare a string variable named replacedStr and initialize it to an empty string "".
    Iterate through the words array using a for-each loop.
    For each word in the words array, check if its length is even or odd.
    If the length of word is even, convert it to uppercase letters using the toUpperCase() method and append it to the replacedStr variable with a space " " appended to it.
    If the length of word is odd, convert it to lowercase letters using the toLowerCase() method and append it to the replacedStr variable with a space " " appended to it.
    Print the original str string with the message "Original string: " using the System.out.println() method.
    Print the replacedStr string with the message "Replaced string: " using the System.out.println() method. Use the trim() method to remove the trailing space at the end of the replaced string.
