ask 1: Counting up to a given number
    Declare an integer variable count and initialize it to 1.
    Use a while loop to print out the value of count on each iteration, until count reaches a given number (e.g., 10).
    Increment count by 1 on each iteration.
Task 2: Print out even numbers from 2 to 10 using a while loop

    Initialize a variable num to 2.
    Write a while loop that continues as long as num is less than or equal to 10.
    Inside the loop, use an if statement to check if num is even.
    If num is even, print out its value.
    Increment num by 1.
    Run the program and verify that it prints out the even numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 on separate lines
Task3: Print out odd numbers from 1 to 9 using a while loop

    Initialize a variable num to 1.
    Write a while loop that continues as long as num is less than or equal to 9.
    Inside the loop, use an if statement to check if num is odd.
    If num is odd, print out its value.
    Increment num by 1 .
    Run the program and verify that it prints out the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 on separate lines.

Task4
Initialize a variable num to 1.
    Write a while loop that continues as long as num is less than or equal to 25.
    Inside the loop, use an if statement to check if num is a multiple of 5(use modulus operator to check if a number is multiple of 5).
    If num is a multiple of 5, print out its value.
    Increment num by 1.
    Run the program and verify that it prints out the multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25) on separate lines.

Task 5: Print out a countdown from 10 to 1 using a while loop

    Initialize a variable num to 10.
    Write a while loop that continues as long as num is greater than 0.
    Inside the loop, print out the value of num.
    Decrement num by 1.
    Run the program and verify that it prints out the numbers 10 through 1 in descending order.

Task6: Print out the table of 2 using a while loop

    Initialize a variable num to 1.
    Write a while loop that continues as long as num is less than or equal to 10.
    Inside the loop, calculate the product of num and 2.
    Print out a message that says num +"x 2 =" product, where num is the current value of the loop variable and product is the product calculated in step 3.
    Increment num by 1.
    Run the program and verify that it prints out the table of 2 (with each line showing the multiplication of 2 with a number from 1 to 10).
    Here's an example of what the output might look like:
    1 x 2 = 2
    2 x 2 = 4
    3 x 2 = 6
    4 x 2 = 8
    5 x 2 = 10
    6 x 2 = 12
    7 x 2 = 14
    8 x 2 = 16
    9 x 2 = 18
    10 x 2 = 20

Task7 : Print out a multiplication table for a given integer using a while loop

    Create a Scanner object to read user input.
    Prompt the user to enter an integer.
    Initialize a variable num to 1.
    Write a while loop that continues as long as num is less than or equal to 10.
    Inside the loop, calculate the product of num and the user input integer.
    Print out a message that says "num x input = product", where num is the current value of the loop variable, input is the integer entered by the user, and product is the product calculated in step 5.
    Increment num by 1.
    Run the program and verify that it prints out a multiplication table for the integer entered by the user.


Task 8: Print out the sum of the first 10 integers using a while loop

    Initialize a variable num to 1.
    Initialize a variable sum to 0.
    Write a while loop that continues as long as num is less than or equal to 10.
    Inside the loop, add num to sum.
    Increment num by 1.
    Print out the value of sum.
    Run the program and verify that it prints out the sum of the first 10 integers (which is 55).

Task 9: Calculate the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 100 using a while loop

Initialize a variable num to 1.
Initialize a variable sum to 0.
Write a while loop that continues as long as num is less than or equal to 100.
Inside the loop, use an if statement to check if num is odd.
If num is odd, add it to sum.
Increment num by 1.
Print out the value of sum.
Run the program and verify that it correctly calculates the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 100.
answer is 2500
