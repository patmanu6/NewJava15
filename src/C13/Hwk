Task1:
    Create a program that prompts the user to enter a string and then prints out
    the length of the string. To do this, use the length() method of the String class.
Task2:
    Create a program that prompts the user to enter two strings and then concatenates
    them together using the plus operator method of the String class. Print out the concatenated string.
Task3:
    Create a program that prompts the user to enter a string and then converts it to
    uppercase using the toUpperCase() method of the String class. Print out the uppercase string.
Task4:
    Create a program that prompts the user to enter a string and then converts it to lowercase
    using the toLowerCase() method of the String class. Print out the lowercase string.
Task5:
    Create a program that prompts the user to enter a string and then checks if it contains
    a specific substring using the contains() method of the String class. If the string contains
    the substring, print out a message saying so. If it does not, print out a message saying that
    the substring was not found.
Task6:
    Create a program that prompts the user to enter a string and then checks if it starts with
    a specific prefix using the startsWith() method of the String class. If the string starts
    with the prefix, print out a message saying so. If it does not, print out a message saying that
    the prefix was not found.
Task7:
    Create a program that prompts the user to enter a string and then checks if it ends with a
    specific suffix using the endsWith() method of the String class. If the string ends with the
    suffix, print out a message saying so. If it does not, print out a message saying that the suffix
    was not found.

Task8:
     create a variable call it userName and store some String in it
     check userName variable with if else conditions for below
     if username is less than 8 characters print "UserName must be 8 characters"
     if username is more than 16 print "Username can't be more than 16 chars"
     if username contains the word "password " in it print "username can't contain password"
     else print "userName created successfully "
Task9:
    create a String str and store "Java is not easy"
    count how many times the letter a has appeared in above String.
Task10:
    Write a Java program that takes a string as input and prints the first character of the string
    using the charAt method.
Task11
    Write a Java program that takes a string as input and prints the index of the first occurrence of
    the letter 'e' in the string using the indexOf method.
Task12:
    Write a Java program that takes a string as input and reverses the string using the charAt
    method in a loop.
=================================
Tricky ones
Task1:
    Write a Java program that takes a string as input and checks if the string is a palindrome
    (reads the same forwards and backwards) using the charAt method and a loop.

Task2:
    Write a Java program that takes a string as input and removes all occurrences of the letter 's' in the string using the replace method with an empty string.
Task3
    Write a Java program that takes a string as input and replaces all occurrences of the letter 'a' with the letter 'e' using the replace method.
